## Hello there

I'm an 18 year old college sophomore, currently living in Mumbai, India. My interests are computer graphics and neural networking, although I have a fair bit to explore when it comes to the latter.

I have some hands on experience of developing a graphics engine (not the best) using **OpenGL** with C++. Looking to further work on rendering engines.

You can find a planet renderer project I worked on in my repository [glowing-chainsaw](https://github.com/sanidhyaanand/glowing-chainsaw). It's not the cleanest repository but I hope to better that.

I am currently working on integrating physics and (a load of other cool optimizations to my algorithms) to my OpenGL skill basket.
I'm also exploring Micheal Nielsen's book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)(stuff which I ideally should have uploaded on Github, now that I think about it). I would like to start contributing to open source projects some time in the future, but I am currently still learning.

## Status
I am on a hiatus right now due to college workload, and I hope to get started on my physics engine as soon as I figure life out a bit more.

## Hello there

<p>I'm an 18 year old college sophomore, currently living in Mumbai, India. My interests are computer graphics and neural networking, although I have a fair bit to explore when it comes to the latter.</p>

<p>I have some hands on experience of developing a graphics engine (not the best) using OpenGL with C++ and developing a few simple games using **PyGame**. These are currently the only APIs I have worked with.</p>

You can find a planet renderer project I worked on in my repository [glowing-chainsaw](https://github.com/sanidhyaanand/glowing-chainsaw). It's not the cleanest repository but I hope to better that.

I am currently working on integrating physics and (a load of other cool optimizations to my algorithms) to my OpenGL skill basket and hopefully making decent games with PyGame itself. 
I'm also exploring Micheal Nielsen's book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), and have almost completed the digit recognition project (which I ideally should have uploaded on Github, now that I think about it). I would like to start contributing to open source projects some time in the future, but I am currently still learning.

## Status
I am on a hiatus right now due to college workload, and I hope to get started on my physics engine as soon as I figure life out a bit more.
